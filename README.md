# Frequentist Inference: 

In this case study, we’ll learn more about frequentist inference. **Frequentist inference** is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts:

   * The z-statistic
   * The t-statistic
   * The difference and relationship between the two
   * The Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
   * How to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
   * The concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
   * how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval
   * Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
   * Hypothesis testing
    

There are two parts to the case study: 
   * In part A, we’ll learn the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. 
   * In Part B, we’ll apply those implementations to a real-world scenario.
